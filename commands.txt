1. "docker build -t spark-query-project ."
    - This command builds the updated docker image

2. "docker run --rm spark-query-project"
    - This command executes the CMD line within the Dockerfile


Debugging:
1. "docker build --no-cache -t spark-query-project ."

2. "docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/app" spark-query-project"
    - mounting the code from host: changes in local files (in $PWD) are immediately reflected inside the container (no need to rebuild the image. Just rerun)
